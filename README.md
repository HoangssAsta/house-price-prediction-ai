# AI-Driven House Price Prediction

This project develops AI models to predict house prices in Washington, USA using various features.

## Project Overview

Part of MIS373 - Advanced AI For Business course. Uses Python and Jupyter Notebook to analyze a dataset of ~20,000 house sales and develop predictive models.

## Key Components

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Model development (linear regression and neural networks)
- Performance comparison and analysis
- Critical evaluation for real-world deployment

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab (with GPU)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy,matplotlib, tensorflow, etc.

## Results

The results has been summarized in the Andrew_Nguyen_MIS373A2_Task1.ipynb file. The Andrew_Nguyen_MIS373A2_Task1.ipynb file are for training multiple models in order to find the best model for the given case
